#### TODO

* disable line number mode in treemacs buffer
* customize hanging braces, colons, whatnot...only c-offsets-alist (based on "stroustrup" defaults) is relatively complete
* fix lsp-ui popups, heavy-templated code takes half of the screen
  * perhaps better to have it popup on demand
* magit customization

#### FIX
* certain lines can be assigned to both arglist-cont-nonempty and arglist-intro, effectively indenting twice
